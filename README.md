# Digital-Network-Twins

In recent years, the complexity of 5G and beyond wireless networks has escalated, leading to a demand for more innovative management frameworks to handle their intricacies and ensure robust performance. The concept of digital twins (DTs), which are virtual replicas of physical systems, has been adapted to meet this challenge, providing a powerful tool for real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and decision-making processes. In this vein, our paper presents VH-Twin, a novel framework that applies DT to the realm of wireless networks with unprecedented sophistication. VH-Twin distinguishes itself through its Vertical Twinning (V-twinning) and Horizontal Twinning (H-twinning) methods with periodical clustering, named Dynamic Connectivity Segmentation (DCS). DCS is used to group base stations (BSs) based on their attributes and functions. V-twinning capitalizes on the potential of federated learning, allowing BSs to collaborate in developing a shared, yet decentralized, twin model without exchanging local data, thus preserving privacy and reducing bandwidth usage. H-twinning, on the other hand, implements a reactive approach, rapidly updating models in response to detected network anomalies or changes, keeping the DT synchronized with its physical counterpart. The framework is underpinned by a multi-layer federated learning architecture, which strategically segments model training across different network layers, enhancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. VH-Twin's robust architecture not only adapts to the dynamic nature of wireless networks but also stands as a beacon for future research and application in the field, showcasing the significant benefits of DT technologies when integrated with the complexities of modern wireless network environments.
